# Wall-EE

Welcome to the Wall-EE Mars Rover project! Our primary objective was to create a robust rover capable of precise control and reliable movement. Additionally, we aimed to establish seamless communication between the rover's onboard systems and a full stack web application. Our goal was to develop a sophisticated framework that facilitates data transmission and enables interaction with diverse physical hardware components.
